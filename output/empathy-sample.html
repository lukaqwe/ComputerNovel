      <p> It was then ob-served that myhead was<b> invisible</b>.<br>In the sea there are more things<b> invisible</b> than visible!<br>His throat was gripped by<b> invisible</b> fingers, and I left myhold on the handle to defend meself.<br><b> invisible</b> too?<br>Twas in that very chair my poor dear mother used to sit when <b>I</b> was a little girl.<br>Finally <b>I</b> went to sleep in a heap of down quilts, very warm and comfortable.<br>If <b>I</b> have much more of it, I shall go wild--I shall start mowing 'em.<br><b>I</b> heard more men coming, my cook was lying quiet on the other side of the counter, stunned or scared speechless, and I had to make another dash for it, like a rabbit hunted out of a wood-pile.<br><b>I</b> could take my money where I found it.<br>For <b>I</b> remembered, though not very distinctly where, that some theatrical costumiers had shops in that district.<br><b>I</b> had the pleasure of seeing him begin to wash up, and then, finding no good in keeping down there, and the brick floor being cold on my feet, I returned upstairs and sat in his chair by the fire.<br>Did <b>I</b> hear a cat?<br>Understand me, <b>I</b> don't agree to this.<br><b>I</b> was wandering, mad with rage, naked, impotent.<br>In a moment <b>I</b> should be wedged into a crowd and inevitably discovered.<br><b>I</b> say!<br>Nevertheless, <b>I</b> was half-minded to accost some passer-by and throw myself upon his mercy.<br><b>I</b> never thought of that before.<br>Afterwards, prowling through the place in search of blankets--<b>I</b> had to put up at last with a heap of down quilts--I came upon a grocery section with a lot of chocolate and candied fruits, more than was good for me indeed--and some white burgundy.<br><b>I</b> did.<br>How <b>I</b> want sleep!<br>Am <b>I</b> mad?<br><b>I</b> resolved to explore the house, and spent some time in doing so as noiselessly as possible.<br><b>I</b> found a general principle of pigments and refraction--a formula, a geometrical expression involving four dimensions.<br><b>I</b> couldn't think of any other way of doing it.<br><b>I</b> appreciated my loss of sympathy, but I put it down to the general inanity of things.<br>This running warmed me to a certain extent, and <b>I</b> went on with a better courage through the maze of less frequented roads that runs hereabouts.<br>Dodge as <b>I</b> like.<br><b>I</b> clean forgot it.<br><b>I</b> could see right down it.<br><b>I</b> made one last desperate turn and found myself among lamps and ironmongery.<br><b>I</b> know all that.<br><b>I</b> thought that I should be able to slip out unobserved in the morning with my clothes upon me, muffling my face with a white wrapper I had taken, purchase, with the money I had taken, spectacles and so forth, and so complete my disguise.<br>Then <b>I</b> should be able, I thought, to rob the place for food and clothing, and disguised, prowl through it and examine its resources, perhaps sleep on some of the bedding.<br>Of restoring what <b>I</b> have done.<br>It occurred to me that the radiators, if they fell into the hands of some acute well-educated person, would give me away too much, and watching my opportunity, <b>I</b> came into the room and tilted one of the little dynamos off its fellow on which it was standing, and smashed both apparatus.<br>And when <b>I</b> had had it, I sat over a cigar, trying to plan my line of action.<br><b>I</b> was weak and very hungry.<br><b>I</b> edged quietly out of the room, but a plank creaked.<br><b>I</b> clean lost my temper, the fools!<br><b>I</b> had made up my mind, I suppose, to get away in them, and that ruled me.<br><b>I</b> went and peered out through their interstices.</p>

      <p>However, we find that we shall want no more evidence, for on being brought before the inspector at the station he<b> asked</b> leave to make a statement, which was, of course, taken down, just as he made it, by our shorthand man.<br>You<b> speak</b> to your mate upon the left to-night, and see if he is to be trusted.<br>I do not know where I was, nor whom I<b> spoke</b> with, nor anything save what I have told you.<br>I thought that I would just<b> ask</b> you whether you had heard it.<br>If you were<b> asked</b> to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim.<br>I felt that I should have no peace until I knew, and yet I shrank from<b> asking</b> her again after once she had told me what was false.<br>I think I must<b> ask</b> you to remain sitting exactly where you are.<br>That you have really left me very few questions to<b> ask</b>.One winter’s night, as we sat<b> together</b> by the fire, I ventured to suggest to him that, as he had finished pasting extracts into his common-place book, he might employ the next two hours in making our room a little more habitable.<br>He saw the question in my eyes, and, putting his finger-tips<b> together</b> and his elbows upon his knees, he explained the situation.<br>Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may<b> both</b> think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me.<br>The poor girl, however, was herself a prisoner, for there was no one about the house except the man who acted as coachman, and his wife,<b> both</b> of whom were tools of the conspirators.<br>We<b> both</b> ascended, followed by the doctor.<br>They have now fled<b> together</b>.<br>The state-room was next the cabin, and we flocked in there and flopped down on the settees, all speaking<b> together</b>, for we were just mad with the feeling that we were free once more.<br>My father read it, clapped<b> both</b> his hands to his head, and began running round the room in little circles like a man who has been driven out of his senses.</p>

<p> <b>She</b> was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen.<br><b>She</b> smiled quietly, in her old way.<br><b>She</b> came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my hand.<br> <b>She</b> was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.<br><b>I</b> meant the other way.<br>Cried the Unicorn, as <b>I</b> sat with the knife in her hand, very much puzzled how to begin.<br><b>I</b> called to mind that it was already far advanced in the afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means of making a fire.<br> <b>She</b> went in without knocking and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.<br> <b>She</b> said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.<br><b>She</b> came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes.<br><b>I</b> asked doubtfully.<br><b>She</b> smiled quietly, in her old way.<br><b>She</b> ate more than the Carpenter, though,’ said Tweedledee.<br>Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, <b>I</b> should think!<br> <b>She</b> is such a dear, quiet thing.<br><b>She</b> ate more than the Carpenter, though,’ said Tweedledee.<br>A baby, <b>I</b> think, could have caught it.<br><b>She</b> was in the midst of her exposition when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise.<br></p>
