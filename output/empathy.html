      <p> It was then ob-served that myhead was<b> invisible</b>.<br>I turned down the gas again, stepped out of the window on the cistern cover, very softly lowered the sash, and sat down, secure and<b> invisible</b>, but quivering with anger, to watch events.<br>I is<b> invisible</b>!<br>Now, just at present, though the days are quite warm enough for an<b> invisible</b> man to run about stark, the evenings are quite chilly.<br>Presently I relaxes and leans back, and blinks through mysmoke across the room at things<b> invisible</b> to other eyes.<br>I could be<b> invisible</b>!<br>Certainly--but, as a rule, I like to be<b> alone</b> and undisturbed.<br><b>I</b> remember walking back to the empty house, through the place that had once been a village and was now patched and tinkered by the jerry builders into the ugly likeness of a town.<br><b>I</b> apologised.<br><b>I</b> have made a discovery.<br>Suddenly <b>I</b> heard his quick footsteps returning, and the door reopened.<br><b>I</b> was beginning to feel frightened.<br>Do <b>I</b> look like an insane person?<br>And <b>I</b> worked three years, and every mountain of difficulty I toiled over showed another from its summit.<br>It was late at night--in the daytime one was bothered with the gaping, silly students--and <b>I</b> worked then sometimes till dawn.<br><b>I</b> stood up too.<br><b>I</b> scrambled to my feet, looking about me for some way of escape, and even as I did so the sound of my movement made them aware of me.<br>My first visit was to the place where <b>I</b> had seen stockings and gloves for sale.<br>And incidentally of course <b>I</b> could rob the house of any available money.<br>Can't use 'em as <b>I</b> can see.<br>She came in, purring--the poor beast was starving--and <b>I</b> gave her some milk.<br><b>I</b> resolved to explore the house, and spent some time in doing so as noiselessly as possible.<br>Then <b>I</b> heard heavy feet striding across a room, and a man appeared down the shop.<br>Then <b>I</b> might hope to plan.<br><b>I</b> had never realised it before, but the nose is to the mind of a dog what the eye is to the mind of a seeing man.<br><b>I</b> had no refuge, no appliances, no human being in the world in whom I could confide.<br><b>I</b> was thinking only last night of the sea larvae and all jelly-fish!<br><b>I</b> can't feel his heart.<br>But--<b>I</b> say!<br>My nose had been a difficulty indeed--<b>I</b> had thought of paint.<br><b>I</b> didn't know the blessed turning, that was all!<br><b>I</b> had one hope.<br><b>I</b> want help badly.<br>Then <b>I</b> fell to scheming again.<br><b>I</b> heard more men coming, my cook was lying quiet on the other side of the counter, stunned or scared speechless, and I had to make another dash for it, like a rabbit hunted out of a wood-pile.<br><b>I</b> have it still.<br><b>I</b> staggered out of the way of the cab, avoided a perambulator by a convulsive movement, and found myself behind the hansom.</p>

      <p>She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though<b> asking</b> a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand.<br>As he<b> spoke</b> the door opened and a young lady entered the room.<br>It was only a line<b> asking</b> me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.<br>Still, I must<b> ask</b> you to humour me a little further.<br>I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was<b> asked</b> to step up to the room.<br>But when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to<b> ask</b> me whether I were glad or sorry to see him.<br>You must<b> speak</b> to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it.<br>Your very voice changes as you<b> speak</b>.I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought<b> together</b> by that single advertisement.<br>The first had walked<b> both</b> ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other.<br>Holmes edged his way round the wall and flinging the shutters<b> together</b>, he bolted them securely.<br>His hands and feet were securely strapped<b> together</b>, and he bore over one eye the marks of a violent blow.<br>Then we shall<b> both</b> come.<br>We’ll have our lunch here, if you will permit us, and then we shall all three set off for town<b> together</b>.<br>We’ll call a cab and go<b> together</b>.<br>Surprise and satisfaction were<b> both</b> for an instant to be read upon his eager face, though when she glanced round to find out the cause of his silence he had become as demure as ever.</p>

      <h3>I vs He</h3>
<p>And then, looking more nearly into their features, <b>I</b> saw some further peculiarities in their Dresden china type of prettiness.<br> <b>He</b> did not venture to go near the house till he had brought himself down to nine inches high.<br><b>I</b> should never have known who were the right people to invite!<br> <b>He</b> came flying out of the wood over yonder--How fast those Queens CAN run!<br>Only my disinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion that if <b>I</b> began to slake my thirst for murder my Time Machine might suffer, restrained me from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes I heard.<br>I’m nearly worn out, but <b>I</b> shan’t sleep till I’ve told this thing over to you.<br><b>He</b> can’t do Addition,’ the Red Queen interrupted.<br>’ <b>He</b> was so hoarse that Alice could scarcely hear him.<br><b>I</b> don’t deny things with my HANDS,’ I objected.<br>At last <b>I</b> sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this strange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and making uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat on them.<br>They were the only tears, except my own, <b>I</b> ever saw in that Golden Age.<br>Just what <b>I</b> was going to remark myself.<br>And in the westward sky, <b>I</b> saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon.<br> <b>He</b> reached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end.<br>’ <b>He</b> was out of the room in a moment, and ran down stairs--or, at least, it wasn’t exactly running, but a new invention of hers for getting down stairs quickly and easily, as Alice said to himself.<br>Then <b>I</b> like the Carpenter best--if he didn’t eat so many as the Walrus.<br>The egg seems to get further away the more <b>I</b> walk towards it.<br>As <b>I</b> stood staring, the door into the garden opened, and the man-servant appeared.<br><b>I</b> THINK you did--however, you’d better not mention it to your friends just yet, for I’m not sure.<br><b>He</b> took me for his housemaid!<br><b>I</b> asked in an astonished tone.<br><b>I</b> retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck my third.<br> <b>He</b> was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise.<br>Still she haunts me, phantomwise, <b>I</b> moving under skies Never seen by waking eyes.<br>He was part of my dream, of course--but then <b>I</b> was part of his dream, too!<br> Shaking  <b>He</b> took his off the table as he spoke, and shook his backwards and forwards with all his might.<br>Then he turned over the hand holding his pipe, and <b>I</b> saw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his knuckles.<br>The view <b>I</b> had of it was as much as one could see in the burning of a match.<br><b>I</b> AM real!<br></p>

      <h2>Death</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <p>One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open, and my cheeks livid like those in<b> death</b>.<br>Because danger and<b> death</b> surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome.<br>I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of<b> death</b>.<br>I was overcome by gloom and misery, and often reflected I had better seek<b> death</b> than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness.<br>I was tried, and condemned to<b> death</b>.<br>Your names adored, as belonging to brave men who encountered<b> death</b> for honour, and the benefit of mankind.<br>That you will seek me, and satisfy my vengeance in his<b> death</b>.<br>This is no jest, but life and<b> death</b>, perhaps more.<br>Life and<b> death</b> appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into my dark world.<br><b>I died.</b></p>
