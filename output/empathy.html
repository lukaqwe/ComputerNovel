      <h2>Solitude</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <p>  I turned down the gas again, stepped out of the window on the cistern cover, very softly lowered the sash, and sat down, secure and<b> invisible</b>, but quivering with anger, to watch events.<br>  I groaned suddenly and leant forward, supporting his<b> invisible</b> head on invisible hands.<br> I asked, holding the<b> invisible</b> arm.<br>I'm an<b> invisible</b> man.<br>I is<b> invisible</b>!<br>Is there such a thing as an<b> invisible</b> animal?<br> In the sea there are more things<b> invisible</b> than visible!<br> His throat was gripped by<b> invisible</b> fingers, and I left myhold on the handle to defend meself.<br>--weary, cold, painful, inexpressibly wretched, and still but half convinced of my<b> invisible</b> quality, I began this new life to which I am committed.<br>I'm<b> invisible</b>.<br> I realised I was<b> invisible</b> and inaudible, that overwhelming forces had their grip on me. <b>I</b> must sleep soon.  <b>I</b> had no shelter--no covering--to get clothing was to forego all my advantage, to make myself a strange and terrible thing. <b>I</b> remember walking back to the empty house, through the place that had once been a village and was now patched and tinkered by the jerry builders into the ugly likeness of a town.  A nautical term, referring to his getting back out of the room, <b>I</b> suppose.  <b>I</b> turned with spots of colour swimming before my eyes to the shadowy fixtures behind me.  <b>I</b> saw in time a blind man approaching me, and fled limping, for I feared his subtle intuitions.  Did <b>I</b> kill that fool of a constable?  A happy thought saved me, and as this drove slowly along <b>I</b> followed in its immediate wake, trembling and astonished at the turn of my adventure. Have <b>I</b> had visions? ' <b>I</b> heard someone shouting.  <b>I</b> could have dropped.  <b>I</b> did so too, startled by his quickness of ear.  <b>I</b> was using that tramp as a money box and luggage carrier, until I decided how to get my books and things sent over to meet me. <b>I</b> heard it--distinct. <b>I</b> don't understand it.  <b>I</b> had one hope.  At last <b>I</b> had a breathing space and rubbed my feet clean with my hands, and so got away altogether. <b>I</b> have it!  <b>I</b> set to work upon my preparations forthwith.  <b>I</b> made no plans in the street.  And <b>I</b> had hardly worked and thought about the matter six months before light came through one of the meshes suddenly--blindingly!  There was, <b>I</b> am afraid, some savage kicking.  'Certainly,' <b>I</b> said. Only one thing could <b>I</b> see clearly before me--the cold exposure and misery of the snowstorm and the night.  In a moment <b>I</b> should be wedged into a crowd and inevitably discovered. Understand me, <b>I</b> don't agree to this.  In one room next to his <b>I</b> found a lot of old clothes.  <b>I</b> left my lair as the crowds diminished, and prowled cautiously out into the less desolate parts of the shop.  <b>I</b> clean forgot it.  <b>I</b> was like a man emerging from a thicket, and suddenly coming on some unmeaning tragedy. No 'ed, <b>I</b> tell ye.  <b>I</b> was now cruelly chilled, and the strangeness of my situation so unnerved me that I whimpered as I ran.  <b>I</b> went over the heads of the things a man reckons desirable.  <b>I</b> tell 'e, 'e ain't gart no 'ed at all. <b>I</b> can't explain it.  And fog--<b>I</b> should be like a fainter bubble in a fog, a surface, a greasy glimmer of humanity. He must get food every day--and <b>I</b> don't envy him.  Silence came upon the place, and <b>I</b> found myself wandering through the vast and intricate shops, galleries, show-rooms of the place, alone.  So <b>I</b> thought.  For some time, wandering through the swathed and darkened departments, <b>I</b> could hear the brooms at work. Do <b>I</b> look like an insane person?  <b>I</b> found I had caught a fresh cold, and had to turn out after a time lest my sneezes should attract attention.  Although the blow had really hurt me, <b>I</b> found something so irresistible in his astonishment that I laughed aloud.  Practically <b>I</b> thought I had impunity to do whatever I chose, everything--save to give away my secret.  <b>I</b> could find no socks, but the hunchback's boots were rather a loose fit and sufficed.  But the stout bolts <b>I</b> had screwed up some days before stopped him. <b>I</b> say!</p>

      <h2>Multitude</h2>

      <p> It was only a line<b> asking</b> me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.<br>I did as he<b> asked</b>, and he put the paper in his pocket.<br> She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though<b> asking</b> a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand.<br>The state-room was next the cabin, and we flocked in there and flopped down on the settees, all<b> speaking</b> together, for we were just mad with the feeling that we were free once more.<br> I refused, as you can imagine, and<b> asked</b> my father how he could allow such a wretch to take such liberties with himself and his household.<br> Might I<b> ask</b> how you know, and how much you know?<br> This young man has left prints upon the stair-carpet which made it quite superfluous for me to<b> ask</b> to see those which he had made in the room.<br> He<b> spoke</b> calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.<br> I was going to call for the police, but she, to my surprise,<b> spoke</b> quite civilly to the fellow.<br> You<b> speak</b> to your mate upon the left to-night, and see if he is to be trusted.<br>I think I must<b> ask</b> you to remain sitting exactly where you are.<br>Ay, we’ll just<b> ask</b> ye when we want ye,’ said she, and shut the door in my face.<br>For how long, may I<b> ask</b>, do you want this sum?<br>I should very much like to<b> ask</b> you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer.<br>’ The girl has sworn that as he<b> spoke</b> she noticed the corner of the little paper packet protruding from his closed hand.<br> She sat thinking for some time after I had<b> spoken</b>, and then, turning to me with a brisk air of resolution, she broke into a remarkable statement which I will condense for your benefit.<br>  As he<b> spoke</b> the door opened and a young lady entered the room.<br> I thought that I would just<b> ask</b> you whether you had heard it.<br>You<b> speak</b> of danger.<br> He opened the table-drawer as he<b> spoke</b>, and I noticed that he slipped his revolver into his pocket.<br>There’s been a gentleman here<b> asking</b> for you, sir.<br> With hardly a word<b> spoken</b>, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner.You see me now when my name has become known far and wide, and when I am generally recognised<b> both</b> by the public and by the official force as being a final court of appeal in doubtful cases. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked<b> together</b> in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. His bed had not been slept in, he had been seen by no one since he had retired to his room the night before, and yet it was difficult to see how he could have left the house, as<b> both</b> windows and doors were found to be fastened in the morning. With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to<b> both</b> of us and strode off upon his way. Perhaps it would have been better for<b> both</b> of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best. Then the fact that the two men were never<b> together</b>, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and<b> together</b> they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. I think that we are<b> both</b> agreed, Inspector that the fragment of paper in the dead man’s hand, bearing, as it does, the very hour of his death written upon it, is of extreme importance. That’s all right, my lass,’ said I, putting out my hand towards her in a kindly way, but she had it in<b> both</b> hers in an instant, and they burned as if they were in a fever. But the two coming<b> together</b>, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. But they<b> both</b> said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us<b> both</b> into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. Again,<b> both</b> father and son agreed as to the place where the man escaped into the road. Of all the facts which were presented to us we had to pick just those which we deemed to be essential, and then piece them<b> together</b> in their order, so as to reconstruct this very remarkable chain of events. I did as she asked me, and they talked<b> together</b> for a few minutes. We<b> both</b> put our eyes to the grating. Finding that their secret was out, and that their prisoner was not to be coerced, the two villains with the girl had fled away at a few hours’ notice from the furnished house which they had hired, having first, as they thought, taken vengeance<b> both</b> upon the man who had defied and the one who had betrayed them. It really would be a good thing that we should all go over the house<b> together</b> and make certain that this rather erratic burglar did not, after all, carry anything away with him. I wish you<b> both</b> to be there as witnesses. I had been drinking hard of late, and the two things<b> together</b> fairly turned my brain. Holmes edged his way round the wall and flinging the shutters<b> together</b>, he bolted them securely.</p>

      <h3>I vs She</h3>
<p>I’m very glad I happened to be in the way,’ <b>I</b> said, as she helped her to put on her shawl again.<br>And up the hill <b>I</b> thought I could see ghosts.<br><b>She</b> seemed to have fainted.<br>In a moment <b>I</b> was wet to the skin.<br> <b>She</b> came flying out of the wood over yonder--How fast those Queens CAN run!<br><b>She</b> left it dead, and with its head She went galumphing back.<br>At this, <b>I</b> got up and walked off.<br>With a frightful qualm, <b>I</b> turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna of another monster crab that stood just behind me.<br>Towards that, as yet, <b>I</b> had only my iron mace.<br> <b>She</b> was in the midst of her exposition when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise.<br> <b>She</b> thought it was her own helmet.<br> <b>She</b> came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes.<br>  <b>She</b> looked at the Queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up in wool.<br> <b>She</b> had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry--a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings.<br> <b>She</b> laughed when she saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake.<br><b>She</b> gets more and more like a porcupine every minute!<br>  <b>She</b> was looking about for some way of escape, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air.<br>  <b>She</b> was dressed in tin armour, which seemed to fit her very badly, and she had a queer-shaped little deal box fastened across her shoulder, upside-down, and with the lid hanging open.<br>I’m sure I didn’t mean--’ <b>I</b> was beginning, but the Red Queen interrupted her impatiently.<br><b>I</b> was glad to see that it revived him a good deal.<br>Very gently, now, <b>I</b> slowed the mechanism down.<br> <b>She</b> took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed.<br>I’m sure MINE only works one way,’ <b>I</b> remarked.<br> <b>She</b> went in without knocking and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.<br> <b>She</b> spoke like one who was trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him.<br><b>I</b> felt I lacked a clue.<br>As <b>I</b> did so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm.<br>My iron bar still gripped, <b>I</b> followed in the Morlocks’ path.<br> <b>She</b> was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.<br>  <b>She</b> looked at the Queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up in wool.<br></p>

      <h2>Death</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <p>Was it that I wanted, now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a fearful<b> death</b>?<br>There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers, and<b> death</b> was made as little repulsive as might be.<br>The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and<b> death</b>, felt not as I did, such deep and bitter agony.<br>On your living soul I charge you that you do not die--nay, nor think of<b> death</b>--till this great evil be past.<br>To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to<b> death</b>.<br>I was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and<b> death</b>.<br>Yet still the words of the fiend rung in my ears like a<b> death</b>-knell, they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.<br>But to fail here, is not mere life or<b> death</b>.<br>Balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt, which would pursue me until<b> death</b>.<br>Polluted by crimes, and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in<b> death</b>?<br>I began to think that the<b> deaths</b> of myfavourites was a judgment from heaven to chastise mypartiality.<br>Tell me what new scene of<b> death</b> has been acted, and whose murder I am now to lament?<br>You took me on board when my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a<b> death</b> which I still dread--for my task is unfulfilled.<br>That this was especially so when<b> death</b> had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering.<br>And that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and<b> death</b>.<br>If ever a face meant<b> death</b>--if looks could kill--we saw it at that moment.<br>I have strangled the innocent as they slept, and grasped to<b> death</b> mythroat who never injured me or any other living thing.<br>And the poor souls, I can pity them now and weep, as I think of them placid each in myfull sleep of<b> death</b> for a short moment ere fading.<br>Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a daemon, whose delight is in<b> death</b> and wretchedness?<br>I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to<b> death</b>, and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.<br>Because danger and<b> death</b> surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome.<br>It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to<b> death</b>, of the house of mourning, and to rush into the thick of life.<br><b>I died.</b></p>
