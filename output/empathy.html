      <p>  'I could be<b> invisible</b>!<br> I turned down the gas again, stepped out of the window on the cistern cover, very softly lowered the sash, and sat down, secure and<b> invisible</b>, but quivering with anger, to watch events.<br> I stopped the gas engine, felt for and stroked the beast, which was still insensible, and then, being tired, left it sleeping on the<b> invisible</b> pillow and went to bed.<br><b> Invisible</b>.<br>Is there such a thing as an<b> invisible</b> animal? my feet hurt exceedingly and<b> I</b> was lame from a little cut on one foot. <b> I</b> stood up too. <b> I</b> found I had caught a fresh cold, and had to turn out after a time lest my sneezes should attract attention. <b> I</b> let the whole down with a smash on the cabman, and then, with shouts and the clatter of feet about me, people coming out of shops, vehicles pulling up, I realised what I had done for myself, and cursing my folly, backed against a shop window and prepared to dodge out of the confusion. <b> I</b> contrived to enter, and walking down the shop--it was a department where they were selling ribbons and gloves and stockings and that kind of thing--came to a more spacious region devoted to picnic baskets and wicker furniture. <b> I</b> gritted my teeth and stayed there to the end.  It was late at night--in the daytime one was bothered with the gaping, silly students--and<b> I</b> worked then sometimes till dawn.  'I am disfigured,'<b> I</b> said. <b> I</b> had to do my work under frightful disadvantages. <b> I</b> couldn't think of any other way of doing it. <b> I</b> have it still. <b> I</b> must get steady a bit.  In one room next to his<b> I</b> found a lot of old clothes. <b> I</b> have no taste for politics, for the blackguardisms of fame, for philanthropy, for sport. <b> I</b> had made up my mind, I suppose, to get away in them, and that ruled me. <b> I</b> gather it was a secret. <b> I</b> heard a miaow behind me, and turning, saw a lean white cat, very dirty, on the cistern cover outside the window. when the clock-mending is over,<b> I</b> think I should like to have some tea. <b> I</b> could have dropped. <b> I</b> took some brandy and water, and then went up past my impromptu bag--he was lying quite still--to the room containing the old clothes.  In a moment<b> I</b> should be wedged into a crowd and inevitably discovered. <b> I</b> was half minded to hit his silly countenance, but I arrested my doubled fist.  If<b> I</b> can lay my hands on him! '<b> I</b> said. <b> I</b> told him to get out. <b> I</b> was weak and very hungry.  altogether<b> I</b> had barely twenty pounds left in the world, for the most part in a bank--and I could not afford that. <b> I</b> saw pretty clearly this was a transient mood, due to overwork and want of sleep, and that either by drugs or rest it would be possible to recover my energies.</p>

      <p>Ay, we’ll just<b> ask</b> ye when we want ye,’ said she, and shut the door in my face.<br> I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to<b> speak</b> to me?<br>did your butler ever<b> ask</b> you such a question?<br> It was only a line<b> asking</b> me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.<br>’ I<b> asked</b> as she entered.<br>As he<b> spoke</b> we came round the curve of the avenue, and saw in the fading light that every blind in the house had been drawn down.<br>that you have really left me very few questions to<b> ask</b>.<br>She told me to<b> ask</b> you.<br>She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to<b> speak</b> to you.<br>  It was not the first time that she had<b> spoken</b> to us of her husband’s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion.<br>As he<b> spoke</b> he opened a door and showed the way into a room which appeared to be very richly furnished, but again the only light was afforded by a single lamp half-turned down.<br>For how long, may I<b> ask</b>, do you want this sum? answered the other, making obvious efforts to pull himself<b> together</b>, and licking his dry lips before he spoke. though they had some legal<b> bother</b> and a considerable sum to pay before they were allowed to retain it. As you<b> both</b> locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. We’ll call a cab and go<b> together</b>. The state-room was next the cabin, and we flocked in there and flopped down on the settees, all speaking<b> together</b>, for we were just mad with the feeling that we were free once more. Well, they ought to be, but they’ve had a lawsuit for some years which has sucked the blood out of<b> both</b> of them, I fancy. I wish you were all at the devil<b> together</b>. I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off<b> both</b> my hat and the bird.</p>

<p> <b>He</b> hesitated.<br><b> I</b> judged then that the children of that time were extremely precocious, physically at least, and I found afterwards abundant verification of my opinion.<br> At first<b> I</b> scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but these new sensations.<br> <b>He</b> jumped up in such a hurry that he tipped over the jury-box, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below.<br>’ <b>He</b> added in a tone of delight, and his heart began to beat quick with excitement as he went on.<br> <b>He</b> stared round the room.<br> <b>He</b> watched him a little anxiously as he took it.<br>whether<b> I</b> can see it or not!<br><b> I</b> felt I lacked a clue.<br><b> I</b> shivered, and a deadly nausea seized me.<br><b> I</b> could not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed.<br> Like this, you know--’  <b>He</b> let go the bridle, and stretched out both his arms to show Alice what he meant, and this time he fell flat on his back, right under the horse’s feet.<br>So far as<b> I</b> could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant richness as the Thames valley.<br> <b>He</b> went on growing and growing and very soon he had to kneel down on the floor.<br> Looking back presently,<b> I</b> could see, through the crowded stems, that from my heap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a curved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill.<br>No, indeed,’<b> I</b> said, a little anxiously.<br><b> I</b> thought of the Time Traveller limping painfully upstairs.<br><b> I</b> couldn’t see who was sitting beyond the Beetle, but a hoarse voice spoke next.<br> Like this, you know--’  <b>He</b> let go the bridle, and stretched out both his arms to show Alice what he meant, and this time he fell flat on his back, right under the horse’s feet.<br> <b>He</b> hesitated.<br><b>He</b> gets more and more like a porcupine every minute!<br> <b>He</b> was a little startled, however, when he heard the voice of the Duchess close to his ear.<br> There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow footprints like those<b> I</b> could imagine made by a sloth.<br> It’ll be easy enough to get through--’ <b>He</b> was up on the chimney-piece while he said this, though he hardly knew how he had got there.<br> <b>He</b> stopped, held out his glass for more, and took it off at a draught.<br> <b>He</b> always seemed to me, I fancy, more human than he was, perhaps because his affection was so human.<br>Said<b> I</b> loudly.<br><b> I</b> am absolutely certain there was no trickery.<br><b> I</b> knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it.<br><b> I</b> was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper.<br></p>
<h3>I or He vs I and He</h3>
<p><b> I</b> had first seen the place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished and  <b>He</b> was a little startled, however, when he heard the voice of the Duchess close to his ear.<br><b> I</b> said at last and <b>He</b> struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but indescribably frail.<br>I carefully lowered Weena from my shoulder as<b> I</b> halted, and sat down upon the turf.<br>If your Majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, I’ll do it as well as<b> I</b> can and  <b>He</b> was part of my dream, of course--but then I was part of his dream, too!<br> This is the driest thing<b> I</b> know.<br> And then<b> I</b> remembered that strange terror of the dark and  It’ll be easy enough to get through--’ <b>He</b> was up on the chimney-piece while he said this, though he hardly knew how he had got there.<br> Then<b> I</b> saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature and  <b>He</b> took down a jar from one of the shelves as he passed.<br>She was now working with fourteen pairs at once, and<b> I</b> couldn’t help looking at her in great astonishment and  <b>He</b> took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we returned to the smoking-room.<br> Yet her distress when<b> I</b> left her was very great, her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I had as much trouble as comfort from her devotion.<br><b> I</b> wonder what’ll become of MY name when I go in?<br>for<b> I</b> never was so small as this before, never!<br> but this phantasm vanished as<b> I</b> rubbed my eyes and <b>He</b> struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but indescribably frail.<br> so<b> I</b> sat down again, took off my shoes, and flung them away.<br>Weena,<b> I</b> was glad to find, was fast asleep and  <b>He</b> said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.<br> And then<b> I</b> remembered that strange terror of the dark and   <b>He</b> was dressed in tin armour, which seemed to fit him very badly, and he had a queer-shaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder, upside-down, and with the lid hanging open.<br><b> I</b> began to recognise our own pretty and familiar architecture, the thousands hand ran back to the starting-point, the night and day flapped slower and slower.<br>I do not know how long<b> I</b> sat peering down that well.<br> At the sight of him<b> I</b> suddenly regained confidence and <b>He</b> can’t do sums a BIT!<br> At last, some time before<b> I</b> stopped, the sun, red and very large, halted motionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with a dull heat, and now and then suffering a momentary extinction and  <b>He</b> was close behind it when he turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen.<br><b> I</b> had been restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and that sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps and  <b>He</b> looked at the Medical Man.<br>Presently<b> I</b> thought what a fool I was to get wet and <b>He</b> gets more and more like a porcupine every minute!<br>I wish Queens never asked questions,’<b> I</b> thought to myself.<br> May<b> I</b> have them?<br><b> I</b> was silent.<br> This is the driest thing<b> I</b> know.<br> At last, some time before<b> I</b> stopped, the sun, red and very large, halted motionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with a dull heat, and now and then suffering a momentary extinction and  <b>He</b> was close behind it when he turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen.<br><b> I</b> was more and more puzzled and  <b>He</b> tucked his arm affectionately into Alice's and they walked off together.<br> What strange developments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation,<b> I</b> thought, might not appear when I came to look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes!<br>In hopes some bees may make a nest in it--then<b> I</b> should get the honey and  It’ll be easy enough to get through--’ <b>He</b> was up on the chimney-piece while he said this, though he hardly knew how he had got there.<br> For my own part<b> I</b> was unable to come to a conclusion.<br></p>
