      <p> A transparent thing becomes<b> invisible</b> if it is put in any medium of almost the same refractive index.<br>I felt<b> alone</b> in the room and looked up, and there, grey and dim, was the bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly, with a mist of green spots drifting in front of them.<br>I realised I was<b> invisible</b> and inaudible, that overwhelming forces had their grip on me.<br>The<b> invisible</b> rag and pillow came to hand and I opened the window and pitched them out on to the cistern cover.<br>For a moment <b>I</b> was paralysed.<br>And for this <b>I</b> had become a wrapped-up mystery, a swathed and bandaged caricature of a man!<br>It could not have been more than an hour after <b>I</b> took up my position on the mattresses before I noticed the blinds of the windows being drawn, and customers being marched doorward.<br>This running warmed me to a certain extent, and <b>I</b> went on with a better courage through the maze of less frequented roads that runs hereabouts.<br><b>I</b> do not know how they settled the business.<br>And which is the ugliest pair in the whole blessed universe, I'm darned if <b>I</b> know!<br><b>I</b> couldn't think of any other way of doing it.<br><b>I</b> say--!<br><b>I</b> felt as a seeing man might do, with padded feet and noiseless clothes, in a city of the blind.<br>Here am <b>I</b> .<br><b>I</b> ran round and got into the cab.<br><b>I</b> was wandering, mad with rage, naked, impotent.<br><b>I</b> was hungry.<br>Upstairs was a refreshment department, and there <b>I</b> got cold meat.<br>Can't use 'em as <b>I</b> can see.<br><b>I</b> heard it--distinct.<br>Am <b>I</b> imagination?<br><b>I</b> thought I was killing myself and I did not care.<br><b>I</b> seed through the tear of his trousers and the tear of his glove.<br><b>I</b> have it still.<br><b>I</b> heard him come shuffling up to my floor, hesitate, and go down.<br><b>I</b> slept during the forenoon, pulling the sheet over my eyes to shut out the light, and about midday I was awakened again by a knocking.<br>My first visit was to the place where <b>I</b> had seen stockings and gloves for sale.<br>But <b>I</b> didn't rightly hear it.<br><b>I</b> made a step, the boy started back with an exclamation, and with a rapid movement I swung myself over into the portico of the next house.<br><b>I</b> was surprised to find, now that my prize was within my grasp, how inconclusive its attainment seemed.<br><b>I</b> found it hard to sleep.<br>Shall <b>I</b> hide?<br>Fool that <b>I</b> am!<br>Did <b>I</b> kill that fool of a constable?</p>

      <p>When you took my money you said that if ever I wanted any I was to<b> ask</b> you for it.<br>Windibank,<b> asking</b> him whether he could meet us here at six o’clock to-morrow evening.<br>Ay, we’ll just<b> ask</b> ye when we want ye,’ said she, and shut the door in my face.<br>I refused, as you can imagine, and<b> asked</b> my father how he could allow such a wretch to take such liberties with himself and his household.<br>Indeed, it was almost mesmeric, the effect which this giggling ruffian had produced upon the unfortunate linguist, for he could not<b> speak</b> of him save with trembling hands and a blanched cheek.<br>Again and again I had to<b> ask</b> him whether he would give in and sign the documents.<br>In case he wished to<b> ask</b> any questions.<br>My advice to you, sir, is to<b> speak</b> the truth.<br>You<b> speak</b> of danger.<br>As he<b> spoke</b> we came round the curve of the avenue, and saw in the fading light that every blind in the house had been drawn down.<br>He chuckled to himself as he<b> spoke</b>, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.<br>It was not the first time that she had<b> spoken</b> to us of her husband’s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion.<br>But I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could<b> ask</b> advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.<br>You will<b> ask</b> me why I did not dispose of it?I introduced him in a few words, and we<b> both</b> sat down.<br>I wonder, since you are<b> both</b> maiden ladies, that you do not keep house together.<br>His aversion to women and his disinclination to form new friendships were<b> both</b> typical of his unemotional character, but not more so than his complete suppression of every reference to his own people.<br>The two sat down<b> together</b> in the bow-window of the club.<br>The first had walked<b> both</b> ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other.<br>That’s all right, my lass,’ said I, putting out my hand towards her in a kindly way, but she had it in<b> both</b> hers in an instant, and they burned as if they were in a fever.<br>Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may<b> both</b> think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me.<br>It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted<b> both</b> to her husband and to her little son.</p>

      <h3>I vs She</h3>
<p><b>I</b> said in a surprised tone, taking out her purse.<br><b>I</b> slipped on the uneven floor, and fell over one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin.<br> <b>She</b> watched him a little anxiously as she took it.<br>’  <b>She</b> spoke to the Red Queen, whose answer was a little wide of the mark.<br>In the matter of sepulture, for instance, <b>I</b> could see no signs of crematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs.<br><b>I</b> had the best of it this time?<br>Later, <b>I</b> was to appreciate how far it fell short of the reality.<br>It let loose the judgment <b>I</b> had suspended upon their clothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features.<br>And when <b>I</b> had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.<br><b>I</b> looked from one to the other in some bewilderment.<br>Noticing that, <b>I</b> noticed for the first time how warm the air was.<br>But <b>I</b> don’t want it done at all!<br>Very gently, now, <b>I</b> slowed the mechanism down.<br> <b>She</b> was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.<br><b>I</b> took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning myself all the time she went on talking.<br>And <b>I</b> haven’t sent the two Messengers, either.<br>If <b>I</b> could only get to the Eighth Square before it gets dark!<br><b>She</b> can’t do Addition,’ the Red Queen interrupted.<br><b>I</b> wonder if that’s the reason insects are so fond of flying into candles--because they want to turn into Snap-dragon-flies!<br><b>I</b> lay down on the edge, for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy.<br>And <b>I</b> haven’t sent the two Messengers, either.<br>Do <b>I</b> look very pale?<br><b>I</b> daresay you’ll see her soon,’ said the Rose.<br>But, so soon as <b>I</b> struck a match in order to see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels, from which their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion.<br><b>I</b> was as fast as--as lightning, you know.<br>This line <b>I</b> trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer.<br>But they were interested by my matches, and <b>I</b> struck some to amuse them.<br>But <b>I</b> can tell you the names of some of them.<br><b>She</b> struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but indescribably frail.<br></p>

      <h2>Death</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <p>Was it that I wanted, now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a fearful<b> death</b>?<br>The poor dear grew white as<b> death</b>, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide.<br>Was it indeed a house of<b> death</b> to which I had come, too late?<br>I might kill me, but<b> death</b> now seemed the happier choice of evils.<br>That this was especially so when<b> death</b> had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering.<br>My judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of<b> death</b>.<br>You, whom I have seen with no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and<b> death</b> that make the rest shudder.<br>Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way--even by<b> death</b>--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment.<br>The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and<b> death</b>, felt not as I did, such deep and bitter agony.<br>As it was, I thought that on the attendant's evidence I could give a certificate of<b> death</b> by misadventure in falling from bed.<br>Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can<b> death</b> be any evil to me?<br>No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which I stood to me--my more than sister, since till<b> death</b> I was to be mine only.<br>The disquisitions upon<b> death</b> and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder.<br>But if you refuse, I will glut the maw of<b> death</b>, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.<br><b>I died.</b></p>
