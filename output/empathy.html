      <h2>Solitude</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      <p> --weary, cold, painful, inexpressibly wretched, and still but half convinced of my<b> invisible</b> quality, I began this new life to which I am committed.<br>  There was a brief struggle to clear a space, and then the circle of eager faces saw the doctor kneeling, as it seemed, fifteen inches in the air, and holding<b> invisible</b> arms to the ground.<br> One could make it<b> invisible</b>!<br> All except the pigments--I could be<b> invisible</b>!<br> The bulk of three cigars had passed into the<b> invisible</b> or diffused as a white ash over the carpet before I spoke again.<br> The world has become aware of its<b> invisible</b> citizen.<br>  And inside, in the artificial darkness of the parlour, into which only one thin jet of sunlight penetrated, the stranger, hungry we must suppose, and fearful, hidden in myuncomfortable hot wrappings, pored through mydark glasses upon mypaper or chinked mydirty little bottles, and occasionally swore savagely at the boys, audible if<b> invisible</b>, outside the windows.<br> Why was I always<b> alone</b> and secretive?<br><b> Invisible</b>.<br> I stepped forward suddenly, and myhand, extended towards the bandage, met<b> invisible</b> fingers.<br> Lucky it was I lived<b> alone</b> and untended in my room. Whatever<b> I</b> did, whatever the consequences might be, was nothing to me. but<b> I</b> can imagine it.  They split a panel,<b> I</b> saw, and in another moment they had broken away the staples of the bolts and stood in the open doorway. <b> I</b> did not know how long it would be before I should become visible from that cause also. what<b> I</b> was really too cold and fatigued to do before, that I am an experimental investigator.  Finally<b> I</b> chose a mask of the better type, slightly grotesque but not more so than many human beings, dark glasses, greyish whiskers, and a wig. <b> I</b> remember myself as a gaunt black figure, going along the slippery, shiny pavement, and the strange sense of detachment I felt from the squalid respectability, the sordid commercialism of the place.  She came in, purring--the poor beast was starving--and<b> I</b> gave her some milk.  In all my great moments<b> I</b> have been alone. <b> I</b> gritted my teeth and stayed there to the end. <b> I</b> might ha' known.  'Certainly,'<b> I</b> said.  indeed<b> I</b> stumbled twice, and there was an unaccustomed clumsiness in gripping the bolt. <b> I</b> proposed to make my way into the house, secrete myself upstairs, watch my opportunity, and when everything was quiet, rummage out a wig, mask, spectacles, and costume, and go into the world, perhaps a grotesque but still a credible figure. <b> I</b> was half minded to hit his silly countenance, but I arrested my doubled fist.  Here am<b> I</b> . and which is the ugliest pair in the whole blessed universe, I'm darned if<b> I</b> know!  for<b> I</b> remembered, though not very distinctly where, that some theatrical costumiers had shops in that district. <b> I</b> must have a confederate. <b> I</b> have it still. I'll stop where<b> I</b> am. <b> I</b> could find no underclothing, but that I could buy subsequently, and for the time I swathed myself in calico dominoes and some white cashmere scarfs.  Escape as<b> I</b> like.  Practically<b> I</b> thought I had impunity to do whatever I chose, everything--save to give away my secret.  What a fool<b> I</b> was! <b> I</b> finished ordering the lunch, told the man I should be back in ten minutes, and went out exasperated.  He let go incontinently, and<b> I</b> swung the whole weight into the air.  To gain time<b> I</b> answered them.  people were going to and fro, and<b> I</b> prowled restlessly about until I came upon a huge section in an upper floor containing multitudes of bedsteads, and over these I clambered, and found a resting-place at last among a huge pile of folded flock mattresses.  But<b> I</b> kept it to myself. <b> I</b> whipped out some chloroform, applied it, and answered the door. <b> I</b> saw in time a blind man approaching me, and fled limping, for I feared his subtle intuitions.  While<b> I</b> was still sitting under the sickly, drowsy influence of the drugs that decolourise blood, there came a repeated knocking at the door. It was only by a frantic effort of will that<b> I</b> dragged myself back to the apparatus and completed the process. It's wild--but<b> I</b> suppose I may drink. I had thought of painting and powdering my face and all that there was to show of me, in order to render myself visible, but the disadvantage of this lay in the fact that<b> I</b> should require turpentine and other appliances and a considerable amount of time before I could vanish again. <b> I</b> made a step, the boy started back with an exclamation, and with a rapid movement I swung myself over into the portico of the next house.  But the stout bolts<b> I</b> had screwed up some days before stopped him. It's cruel,<b> I</b> know. <b> I</b> had to dodge to get out of the way, and as it was, my ankle got stung with the sawdust.  But--odd as it may seem--it did not occur to me at the moment to take off my clothes as<b> I</b> should have done. <b> I</b> just managed to get by him.</p>

      <h2>Multitude</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      <p>did your butler ever<b> ask</b> you such a question?<br>As he<b> spoke</b> we came round the curve of the avenue, and saw in the fading light that every blind in the house had been drawn down.<br> Indeed, it was almost mesmeric, the effect which this giggling ruffian had produced upon the unfortunate linguist, for he could not<b> speak</b> of him save with trembling hands and a blanched cheek.<br>And you intend to<b> ask</b> him?<br> Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he<b> asked</b> a thing which I could not give.<br> If I might<b> ask</b> you to wait here for an instant, I have a question which I should like to put to the maid.<br> I felt that I should have no peace until I knew, and yet I shrank from<b> asking</b> her again after once she had told me what was false.<br> It was only a line<b> asking</b> me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.<br> The public not unnaturally goes on the principle that he who would heal others must himself be whole, and looks<b> askance</b> at the curative powers of the man whose own case is beyond the reach of his drugs.<br>I think that if you knew all that I had in this box you would<b> ask</b> me to pull some out instead of putting others in.<br> I refused, as you can imagine, and<b> asked</b> my father how he could allow such a wretch to take such liberties with himself and his household.<br> Watson, before whom you can<b> speak</b> as freely as before myself.<br> Parker<b> spoke</b> of you, and that brought me here to-night.<br>’ I<b> asked</b>, after we had cordially shaken hands.<br> She<b> spoke</b> a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand.<br>She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to<b> speak</b> to you.<br>  We turned a corner in the lane as he<b> spoke</b>, and there was the building close beside us.<br>that you have really left me very few questions to<b> ask</b>.<br>For how long, may I<b> ask</b>, do you want this sum?<br> but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to<b> ask</b> me whether I were glad or sorry to see him.<br> And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not<b> speak</b> about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.<br>My advice to you, sir, is to<b> speak</b> the truth.For two hours we rambled about<b> together</b>, in silence for the most part, as befits two men who know each other intimately. Again,<b> both</b> father and son agreed as to the place where the man escaped into the road. It really would be a good thing that we should all go over the house<b> together</b> and make certain that this rather erratic burglar did not, after all, carry anything away with him. We<b> both</b> ascended, followed by the doctor. Holmes moved the lamp, and we<b> both</b> bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. They had heard nothing during the night, for they are<b> both</b> sound sleepers. He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands<b> together</b>. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we<b> both</b> rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. They have now fled<b> together</b>. I had been drinking hard of late, and the two things<b> together</b> fairly turned my brain. He saw the question in my eyes, and, putting his finger-tips<b> together</b> and his elbows upon his knees, he explained the situation. We went upstairs<b> together</b>, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. Though they had some legal<b> bother</b> and a considerable sum to pay before they were allowed to retain it. That’s all right, my lass,’ said I, putting out my hand towards her in a kindly way, but she had it in<b> both</b> hers in an instant, and they burned as if they were in a fever. With that he seized my hair in<b> both</b> his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. Finding that their secret was out, and that their prisoner was not to be coerced, the two villains with the girl had fled away at a few hours’ notice from the furnished house which they had hired, having first, as they thought, taken vengeance<b> both</b> upon the man who had defied and the one who had betrayed them. I laid the two tresses<b> together</b>, and I assure you that they were identical. His hands and feet were securely strapped<b> together</b>, and he bore over one eye the marks of a violent blow. It is evident, therefore, that if<b> both</b> girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. One winter’s night, as we sat<b> together</b> by the fire, I ventured to suggest to him that, as he had finished pasting extracts into his common-place book, he might employ the next two hours in making our room a little more habitable. You are two friends of mine who are in want of a billet, and what could be more natural than that I should bring you<b> both</b> round to the managing director?</p>
