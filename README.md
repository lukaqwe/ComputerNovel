# ComputerNovel

This repository contains a program which generates a small novel. The main characters in it are 'I' and a 'He' or 'She' (there is a 50/50 chance of either occurring) and, if the I and He/She pass all levels of empathy,
a 'We'. The text is based on randomness and at every run it gives a different version by selecting sentences from the books found in the folder /lib. If you want to find out more about the text itself please read the documentation-a pdf file found in the folder /doc. Or, if you want to test the program, download the code and run on your system, for instruction please visit the user's manual-a txt file found in the folder /doc.

All contributions or suggestions are warmly welcomed :)
